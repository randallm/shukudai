What's the Homework
===================

What's the Homework (WTH) is an Android collaborative homework manager app. Students can share and upload homework assignments and view them in Facebook-esque news feeds.

Future Plans
------------

I originally started this project with the intent of reimplementing many of the features available in social networking sites. However, I recently realized getting my peers to switch all switch from our existing homework sharing mediums to a service that I built is unpragmatic at best. As a result, [the server client](https://github.com/randallm/whatsthehomework_flask) is being put on the backburner as I migrate the Android app to take advantage of a local database and existing sharing platforms, like NFC and existing social networks.

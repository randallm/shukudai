What's the Homework
===================

What's the Homework (WTH) is an Android collaborative homework manager app. Students can share and upload homework assignments and view them in Facebook-esque news feeds.

WTH is my first foray into mobile development and Java. The code's not very DRY at the moment, and large portions of the code should be refactored before it's in the Play Store. That being said, I've tried to adhere to the Android design guidelines as much as I can, so I think the app does look and feel good.
